### Aim: To design an orifice plate for a typical application

### Objectives
1. Calculate the differential pressure developed across an orifice plate to withstand specific beta value.
2. Study the effect of change in process fluid (service) on the developed differential pressure.
3. Study the effect of change in pressure tapping position.
4. Study the temperature and pressure variations effect on the orifice plate performance.
